/*
 * KreppPlacer - C++ wrapper for krepp phylogenetic placement.
 *
 * krepp answers "where on this backbone tree does each read belong?" by
 * matching k-mers against a prebuilt index and maximising a pseudo-likelihood
 * over candidate edges.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP MODEL:
 * ===============
 * SharedKreppIndex holds the loaded index and the backbone tree. Both are
 * immutable once constructed and the query path only reads them, so a single
 * instance is shared by every thread rather than loaded per thread - indexes
 * routinely run to tens of gigabytes.
 *
 * KreppPlacer holds the per-thread scratch state and refers to the shared
 * index. Construct one per thread.
 *
 * Edge numbering follows the backbone tree. When the supplied Newick carries
 * jplace-style {N} decorations those numbers are reported verbatim, which is
 * what lets placements accumulate against a phylogeny whose edge IDs are
 * assigned elsewhere and must stay stable.

// krepp builds the suffix as "-m<M>r<R>" + ("-frac"|"-no_frac")
// (ext/krepp/src/index.cpp:249-251). Index::load_partial_index reads k, w, h, m,
// r and frac out of each partial's metadata, and LSHF::check_compatible requires
// m, h, k, frac and the LSH positions to match, plus r when frac is true
// (ext/krepp/src/lshf.cpp:163-170). So what has to agree depends on frac:
//   - frac := false: r is the residue that says WHICH partial this is, and is
//     removed. Splitting the residues of one index across jobs and pointing
//     krepp at the collected directory is the supported way to build a large
//     index, so treating a differing r as a different index refuses layouts that
//     work.
//   - frac := true: r is a cumulative threshold (ext/krepp/src/rqseq.cpp:133)
//     and is kept, so a frac := true index is a single partial.
//
// Returns the suffix unchanged if it does not have that shape, so an
// unrecognised name groups only with itself rather than being merged.

// Not the `metadata<suffix>.txt` sidecar. The sidecar is advisory: krepp writes
// it after the binary (ext/krepp/src/index.cpp:410-420), synthesises it when it
// is missing (:122-135), and never consults it for compatibility. The binary is
// mandatory - load_partial_index error_exits without it (:52-55) - it is what
// LSHF::check_compatible is fed from (:57-69), and the completeness check above
// already requires it, so a complete partial always has one. Reading the
// sidecar instead meant a partial that had lost its .txt was silently skipped,
// which mattered most for `w`: krepp compares m, h, k, frac, r under
// frac := true, and the positions, but never w (ext/krepp/src/lshf.cpp:163-170),
// so this is the only w check there
// is, and skipping it produced a wrong placement result with no error at all.
//
// The layout is fixed and carries no version marker, so m, r and frac are read
// back too and checked against `expect_suffix`, which the filename already
// gave us. Those three are the format's own witness: if they disagree, the
// layout has moved and k/w/h cannot be trusted either.
