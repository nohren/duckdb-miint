/*
 * KreppIndexBuilder - C++ wrapper for krepp index construction.
 *
 * The mirror of KreppPlacer: that one loads an index krepp's CLI wrote, this
 * one writes an index KreppPlacer can load, from the same linked krepp. Same
 * PIMPL discipline for the same reason - krepp's headers reach exactly one
 * translation unit, because their klib basenames collide with minimap2's and
 * their seq_nt4_table is a different table of a different length.
 *
 * INPUT IS FILES, NOT MEMORY, AND THAT IS KREPP'S SHAPE
 * ====================================================
 * IndexMultiple::read_input_file takes a path and nothing else. Handed a FASTA
 * it switches to "per sequence" mode, where every record is its own reference -
 * and obtain_build_tree then REFUSES a guide tree in that mode outright
 * (index.cpp: "A guide tree (-t) is incompatible with a per sequence
 * indexing."). So an index with a backbone can only be built the other way:
 * a TSV mapping each reference name to a file of its own.
 *
 * That is why the caller materialises one FASTA per reference. It is not a
 * convenience; it is the only shape that keeps the backbone.
 *
 * ERRORS
 * ======
 * krepp reports fatal errors with error_exit, which is std::exit - a malformed
 * tree would take the DuckDB process down with no SQL error at all.
 * InstallKreppErrorHandler redirects those into KreppFatalError.
 *
 * A throwing handler is only sound because krepp catches at the boundary of
 * every OpenMP region in its index build path and rethrows on the calling
 * thread (bo1929/krepp#14). Before that an exception could not leave a
 * structured block at all, so this build had to compile krepp with _WOPENMP=0
 * to stay correct - which is why there was no thread count to offer.
 *
 * That guarantee is scoped to the BUILD. krepp's index load path still has
 * unguarded critical regions, and KreppPlacer calls into it. The throws
 * reachable there are allocation failures rather than bad input, but an
 * error_exit raised inside one would still terminate the process.
